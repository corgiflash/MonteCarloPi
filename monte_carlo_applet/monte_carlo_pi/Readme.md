# Parallelized Calculation of Pi using Monte Carlo Simulations (DNAnexus Platform App)

Monte Carlo sampling of points in a unit square space is performed to estimate the value of pi. This program is parallelized on the DNAnexus cloud.

This is the source code for an app that runs on the DNAnexus Platform.
For more information about how to run or modify it, see

In a unit square space, the ratio of points that fall within the quadrant of a unit circle with respect to the ratio of all points give an estimation of the ratio of pi over 4. This ratio becomes increasingly accurate with a larger number of monte carlo simulations. Parallelization is performed on 2 levels: By spawning a large number of workers on the cloud; and by making use of all cores available in each worker to perform simulations.
